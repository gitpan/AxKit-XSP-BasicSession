AxKit Session taglib, based on the Cocoon2 Session taglib specification which
can be found at http://xml.apache.org/cocoon2/userdocs/xsp/session.html

QUICK START:

1) Install.
perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

2) Add the following to your httpd.conf:

  AxAddPlugin    Apache::AxKit::Plugin::BasicSession
  AxAddPlugin    Apache::AxKit::Plugin::AddXSLParams::BasicSession
  AxAddXSPTaglib AxKit::XSP::BasicSession
  PerlSetVar BasicSessionDataStore "File"
  PerlSetVar BasicSessionArgs      "Directory => /tmp/sessions"

3) Add the BasicSession namespace to your XSP pages

  xmlns:session="http://www.axkit.org/2002/XSP/BasicSession"

4) Optional: Add the following to your XSL stylesheets for every session key
you want accessible in your stylesheets:

  <xsl:param name="session.keys.KEYNAME"/>

where KEYNAME is the name for your session key.

SECURITY ISSUES:

This module up to 0.22 had security issues. It was found that the
session was not properly invalidated, and so, information may be
carried over, including authorization tokens, to a session even though
the user believed that the previous session was exited. 


EXAMPLE:

See the "example.xsp" page in the root of this distribution.
