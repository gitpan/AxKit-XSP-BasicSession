Revision history for Perl extension AxKit::XSP::BasicSession.

0.23_3	 2005-04-29 03:45
	- Apply a patch from Mike Nachbaur to fix a AddXSLParam
	  problem that made it not get new data in.

0.23_2	 2005-04-28 02:45
	- Invalidation of session didn't work properly, which has
	  obvious SECURITY issues. We found this has a result of a
	  review sparked by inquires by Tom Kirkpatrick.
	- Tom Kirkpatrick pointed out that get-last-accessed-time
	  returned a meaningless time. Mike Nachbaur provided a patch
	  for that.
	- When using a Pg based backend, different defaults should
	  used. 
	- Actually implement the comment in enumerate.
	- Some documentation cleanups.
	- Added quite a lot of debugging statements. 

0.22	 2004-10-14

	- We now use AxKit::Debug for debug messages, but not very 
	  consistently...
